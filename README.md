# -DS18B20_temperature_sensor
MAXIM DS18B20 temperature sensor. One wire, USART-compatible.

This is an example of work with a temperature sensor with one-wire interface.
The data gained from sensor is not processed (raw data) so there is actually no temperature. 
The example created for stm32f107vtc6 cpu (STM3210C-EVAL board)
